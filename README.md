Snake Game in the style of the original Gameboy. Made using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Textures made using Aseprite and color palette is the same as original gameboy. Made in a week to better understand classees and objects in Javascript, learn game design basics, pixel art and animation, and to practice mobile first design. Thank you anyone who plays.
