Snake is a classic game about a hungry snake eating apples with my version being responsive and in the style of the original Gameboy. Made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Textures made using Aseprite and color palette is the same as original gameboy. The gameplay loop consists of the user using either the contollers onscreen or the corresponding controls on their keybaord (i.e the A button is the A key on the keyboard) to control a snke that grows each time it eats an apple. The goal is to get the highest score possible while avoiding the borders or touching any part of the snakes own body. To make it challenging, each time the snake grows the speed increases. To encourage players to get a higher score there is also 3 playable characters which only unlock after a certain hi-score is achieved.

### Challenges and Solutions
I really wanted to make a game that could be played on desktop and on mobile so this is the result. I loved playing flash games as a kid on my computer, so believed I was capable of making my own but instead using JavaScript. This was a very heavy JavaScript project which taugh me a lot, not just about JavaScript syntax and classes, but also understanding pixel art, animation, and game logic as I had to test many endpoints and "special cases" that may occur during gameplay. I also added local storage so users unlocked characters and hi-score could be saved. While testing on mobile I was reminded of how a gameboy felt, so decided to go all in and try and emulate the style by limiting myself to only using the original Gameboy color palette. If this wasn't enough I pushed myself to finish this in a week so I had a deadline to work towards. I am very happy with the results.
